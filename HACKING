CVS guidelines for epiphany-extensions
**************************************

DO NOT commit to the CVS unless you have been given explicit permission from
me (chpe@gnome.org) or, if you want to check in to
extensions/$extension/ directory, from the extension maintainer.
(This doesn't apply to certain people, but they know who they are :)

Please send patches for the build & configure infrastructure to me at
chpe@gnome.org, or to the epiphany mailing list at
http://lists.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/epiphany-list

Send patches for the individual extensions to the maintainer listed in the 
AUTHORS file.

If you are a translator feel free to add new translations, mark strings for
translation, fix typos, etc.

Coding style
************

We adhere to the epiphany coding style. For your convenience, here are a few
guidelines, from epiphany's HACKING file:

In order to keep the code nice and clean we have a few requirements you'll
need to stick to in order to get your patch accepted:

- use 8-space tabs for indentation
- curly brackets are on a new line
- please compare with NULL or FALSE instead of using "!"
- callback functions have a suffix _cb

  Comment blocks are written like this:
  
/**
 * bla_bla_cb: This is an example comment block
 */
