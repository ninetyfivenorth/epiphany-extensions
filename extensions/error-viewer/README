The goal for this extension is to be part of the (as-yet nonexistent) Web

goodies. In the meantime, enjoy.

For HTML validation support, you will need:
- OpenSP development libraries (libosp4 on Debian)
- (to compile) OpenSP development headers (libosp-dev on Debian)
- DTD's for the documents you want to validate
  (sgml-data and w3c-dtd-xhtml on Debian)

If you don't have OpenSP installed, Javascript errors will still be displayed.
