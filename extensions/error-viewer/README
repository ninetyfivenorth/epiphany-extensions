The goal for this extension is to be part of the Web Development extension, which will contain plenty of CSS and page information goodies. In the meantime, enjoy.

To get HTML validation support, install libosp-dev and
w3c-dtd-xhtml if on Debian, or their equivalents on other
systems. I don't know what those *are*, but libosp-dev has the
OpenSP includes (and libraries are part of libosp1, which is a
dependency) and w3c-dtd-xhtml is a package of DTD's for XHTML.
Without OpenSP installed, the error viewer will simply not
contain that functionality (which is darned cool).
This also requires Epiphany newer than Jan 25 2004, because it
adds an entry to the Tools menu.

TODO:
- Show the real URL, not our temp file url

- Clean up the HTML validation stuff. Sometimes it spouts out garbage characters after the 200th character in a single message.

- Once in a while a garbage message is passed from OpenSP. Fix that.

- Disable the action if we're not viewing an HTML file

- Only handles XHTML correctly, I think. Copy some behavior off validator.w3.org

- Make text selectable
