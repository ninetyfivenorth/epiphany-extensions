The goal for this extension is to be part of the Web Development extension, which will contain plenty of CSS and page information goodies. In the meantime, enjoy.

To get HTML validation support, install libosp-dev and
w3c-dtd-xhtml if on Debian, or their equivalents on other
systems. I don't know what those *are*, but libosp-dev has the
OpenSP includes (and libraries are part of libosp1, which is a
dependency) and w3c-dtd-xhtml is a package of DTD's for XHTML.
Without OpenSP installed, the error viewer will simply not
contain that functionality (which is darned cool).
This also requires Epiphany newer than Jan 25 2004, because it
adds an entry to the Tools menu.

TODO:
- Clean up the HTML validation stuff. It works but doesn't look nice.

- Saying where the error comes from would be nice, too. It's not all Javascript errors. ("HTML Error in [blah] on line [blah]...")

- Make text selectable
