Tabs Plugin
===========

This plugin is not completely self-contained, you need to apply the
patch in file "epiphany.diff" to epiphany in order to use this plugin.

You can apply the patch either to the epiphany source tree (remember to
'make install'), or to the installed epiphany ui file (usually
/usr/share/epiphany/epiphany-ui.xml).
