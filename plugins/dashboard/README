*** EXPERIMENTAL PLUGIN ***

Your Epiphany may crash!  Your house probably won't burn down, but you
never now.  Things have been reasonably stable for me.

*** EXPERIMENTAL PLUGIN ***

For this plugin to work you need to apply the epiphany-1.0.3.diff patch to
the code base.  This is known to work against 1.0.2, 1.0.3 and 1.0.6.  Other
versions are unknown.  A patch for 1.1.0 will be coming soon.

See http://www.etc.gen.nz/projects/dashboard for the rest of my modifications
to Dashboard.
