For the moment, you have to ./configure with --prefix=same prefix as you configured
epiphany with.

Please see the README files in the plugin subdirs for information about the
plugins.

How to choose which extensions to build:

./configure --with-extensions=ext1,ext2,...

where ext1, ext2 ... are one of the following:

gestures		Gestures extensions
tabsmenu		Tabs Menu extension
all			All of the above extensions
sample			Sample extensions [not very useful]

Remember that for the tabsmenu extension to work, you need to apply the patch in
extensions/tabsmenu/epiphany.diff, see extensions/tabsmenu/README.
